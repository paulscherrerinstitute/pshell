# Tutorial

PShell contains a __tutorial__ - a set of scripts demonstrating different aspects of PShell using simulated devices.

 * In order to create the required simulated devices:
     - Under "Tutorial" folder select __SimulatedDevices__, right-click it and select __Run__.

 * A set of simulated files and imaging components will be appended to the "Device" panel.
 * Then any of the tutorial files can be executed.    
 * By selecting and right-clicking a tutorial file, it can be promptly executed or transfered to the editor for debugging.
 * The tutorial scripts are organized in sub-folders:
     1. __Basic Scans__: introduces the use of builtin scan commands.
     2. __Scan Features__: demonstrates how to customize scan behaviour and data saving.
     3. __Plotting__: shows how to customize scan plots and how to generate plots manually.
     4. __Advanced Scans__: presents examples of more complex scans.
     5. __Utils__: presents different system utilities: data manipulation, concurrency, EPICS...
     6. __Math__: demonstrates the use of the mathematical utilities.
     7. __Imaging__: demonstrates the image displaying and processing capabilities.
